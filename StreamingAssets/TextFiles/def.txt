1.Prefab
->Prefabs are a pre-fabricated object template. It is a special type of objet that gives full control of configuring the 
objects and later we can reuse anytime in our game.. 
2.Asset Bundle
->An AssetBundle is content that is stored separately from a main game or application and loaded 
(or downloaded, in the case of mobile and online apps) at runtime. 
This helps minimize the impact on network and system resources by allowing customers to download and install only the parts they need.

3.Resources Folder
->It is a reserved folder within unity with some prebuilt function provided by unity to load all your given asset!
->It is good to use in some scenario like initialization time.. 
but
->Improper use of the Resources folder can bloat the size of a projectâ€™s build, 
lead to uncontrollable excessive memory utilization, and significantly increase application startup times.
->Resource.Load is heavy memory operation so dont use in between games.
